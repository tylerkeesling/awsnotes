# S3 - Simple Storage Solution

S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure. durable, highly-scalable **object storage**. Amazon S3 is easy to user, with a simple web services interface to store and retieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

### S3 - The Basics

- Object-based - ie. upload files not OS
- Files can be up to 5TB
- Unlimited storage
- Files are stored in buckets - Universal namespace - Each bucket has web address/DNS - Must be unique globally - ie. https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru - https://awsservice-what-region.ama../bucketname
- After successful upload, will recieve a 200 HTTP status code
- Built for _99.99% availability_
- Amazon _Guarantee 99.9% availability_
- 11 x 9 durability - 99.999999999% durability
- Tierd Storage Available
- Lifecycle management
- Versioning
- Encryption
- Secure your data use Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies - Bucket Policies - bucket level - Access Control Lists - file level

### Data Consistency Model

- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects - Instaneous for new objects
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take time to propogate) - Updating or deleting might take a second - Due to multiple regions need to be updated - Read vs Write is through different places

### Key-Value Store

- Because S3 is object-based, the objects consists of the following: - Key (string; name of the object) - Value (data; made up of a sequence of bytes) - Version Id - Metadata (data about data you're storing) - Subresources: - Access Control Lists - Torrent

### Storage Tiers/Classes

- **S3 Standard** - 0 to 5 TB - 99.99% availibility - 11x9 durability - Stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities - Designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently

- **S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed)** - < 128kBs - For data that is accessed less frequently - Rapid access still available (maybe a couple of ms or secs) - Lower fee than S3, but charged a retrieval fee

- **S3 One Zone - IA** - < 128kBs - Lower cost for infrequently accessed data - No redundancy in availability zones

- **Glacier** - Cheapest option - Archival use only - Expedidited, Standard, or Bulk retrieval - An Expedidited retrieval time takes a few minutes (higher fee) - A Standard retrieval time takes 3 - 5 hours - Bulk retrieval time takes 5 - 12 hours

A retrieval is charged for everything BUT S3 Standard

### S3 Charges

- Charged for: - Storage (per GB) - Requests - Storage Management Pricing (tags, metadata) - Data Transfer Pricing - Transfer Acceleration - Enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between end users and an S3 bucket - TA uses CloudFront to distribute data to Edge location, then data is routed to the S3 bucket over an optimized network path - Uses Amazon's backbone to move data faster
