# EC2 or Elastic Cloud Compute

## What is EC2? -> Resizable Compute Capacity in the Cloud

Amazon **Elastic Compute Cloud** is a web service that provides *resizable computer capactiy in the cloud*. EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. <br>

EC2 changes the economics of computer by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

## EC2 Options
- **On Demand**
	- Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment
- **Reserved**
	- Provides you with a capacity reservation
	- Offers a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance
	- 1 Year or 3 Year terms
- **Spot**
	- Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity
	- Provides even greated savings if your applications have flexible start and end times
	- If a Spot instance is terminated by Amazon, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for the complete hour in which the instance ran
- **Dedicated Hosts**
	- Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use
	- DH can help reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses

## Use Cases for Options (Pricing models)
- **On Demand**
	- Users who want low cost and flexibility without up-front payment
	- Apps with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that can't be interrupted
	- Apps being developed or tested on EC2 for the first time
- **Reserved**
	- Apps with steady state or predictable usage
	- Apps that require reserved capacity
	- Users can make up-front payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
		- *Standard RIs*
			- Up to 75% off on-demand
		- *Convertable RIs*
			- Up to 54% off on-demand
			- Feature the capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of RIs of equal or greater value
		- *Scheduled RIs*
			- Available to launch within a given time window you reserve
			- Allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable reoccuring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, a week, or a month
- **Spot**
	- Apps that have flexible start and end times
	- Apps that are only feasible at very low compute prices
	- Users with an urgent need for large amounts of additional compute capacity
- **Dedicated Hosts**
	- Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
	- Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
	- Can be purchased On-Demand (hourly)
	- Can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off the On-Demand price

## EC2 Instance Types
**Fight Dr Mc Px**
- F for FPGA
- I for IOPS (input/output operations per second)
- G for Graphics
- H for High Disk Throughput
- T for cheap general purpose (think T2 Micro)
- D for Density
- R for RAM
- M for main choice for general purpose apps
- C for compute
- P for graphics (think pics)
- X for Extreme Memory

## What is Elastic Block Storage?
A virtual disk that is attached to an EC2 instance.<br>

Amazon EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attch them to EC2 instances. Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. EBS volumes are placed in a specific AZ, where they are replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component.

## EBS Volume Types
- **General Purpose SSD (GP2)**
	- General purpose, balances both price and performance
	- Ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10,000 IOPS and the ability to burst up to 3000 IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes at 3334 GiB and above
- **Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)**
	- Designed for I/O intensive apps such as large relational or NoSQL databases
	- Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
	- Can provision up to 20,000 IOPS per volume
- **Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)**
	- Big data, data warehouses, log processing
	- Cannot be a boot volume (has to be an additional volume)
- **Cold HDD (SC1)**
	- Lowest cost storage for infrequently accessed workloads
	- File server
	- Cannot be a boot volume
- **Magnetic (Standard)**
	- Previous generation
	- Lowest cost per gb of all EBS volume types that is *bootable*
	- Ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently
	- Apps where the lowest storage cost is important
