# EC2 or Elastic Cloud Compute

### What is EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable computer capactiy in the cloud. EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. <br>

EC2 changes the economics of computer by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.
