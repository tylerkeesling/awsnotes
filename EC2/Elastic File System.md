# Amazon Elastic File System, or EFS

Amazon EFS is a file storage service for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. EFS is easy to use and provides a simple interface that allows you to create and configure file systems quickly and easily. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so your applications have the storage they need, when they need it.
