# S3 Labs

## Create an S3 Bucket
- Handle buckets globally
- DNS namespace for buckets (web address)
- By default, all buckets are private
- Encryption
	- Client Side Encryption
	- Server Side Encryption
		- SSE with Amazon S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
		- SSE with KMS (SSE-KMS) (did not cover)
		- SSE with Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C)
- Control access to buckets using either a bucket ACL (Access Control Log) or using Bucket Policies
- By default, buckets are private and all objects stored inside of them are private

## Versioning
- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
- Objects stored in bucket before versioning have a version ID of *null*
- When versioning is enabled, the objects do not change but the way S3 handles the objects does
- Great backup tool
- Buckets can be in one of three states:
	- unversioned (the default)
	- versioning-enabled
	- versioning-suspended
- Once enabled, Versioning *cannot be disabled, only suspended*
- Integrates with **Lifecycle rules**
	- Object expiration policy
	- If you have an object expriation lifecycle polocy in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy
	- The noncurrent expiration policy will manage the dletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-anbled bucket
	- A version-enabled bucket maints one current and zero or more noncurrent object versions
	- Transition to one type of storage to another
- Versioning's MFA Delete capability can be used to provide an additional layor of security
- When versioning

## Cross Region Replication
- Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets
- Regions must be unique
- Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically
	- Easiest way to replicate is via the command line
	- `aws s3 copy s3://bucketToCopySource s3://bucketToCopyDestination`
	- All subsequent updated files will be replicated automatically
- You cannot replicate to mulitple buckets or use daisy chaining (at this time)
- Delete markers are replicated
- Deleting individual versions or delete markets will not be replicated
- Understand what Cross Region Replication is at a high level

## Lifecycle Management
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning
- Can be applied to current versions and previous versions
- Can transfer to Standard-IA after 30 days as (Standard)
- Can transfer to Glacier after 30 days as (Standard-IA)
- Can transfer to Glacier after any days if object is transferred to One Zone-IA
- Following actions can now be done:
	- Transition to the Standard - Infrequent Access Storage Class (30 days after the creation date)
	- Archive to the Glacier Storage Class (30 days after IA, if relevant)
	- Permanently delete
- Actions performed by lifecycle configuration are not replicated in CRR
